DATE FRUIT IDENTIFICATION ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING

This project focuses on the identification and classification of date fruits using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing and date fruit classification using various classifiers.

OVERVIEW

Date fruits are a popular and nutritious food consumed worldwide. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different varieties of date fruits based on their visual characteristics. The project leverages Python's machine learning libraries to preprocess the data and train classification models.

FEATURES

•	Data Preprocessing: The raw data containing images of date fruits is preprocessed to extract relevant features and prepare it for classification.

•	Date Fruit Classification: Several machine learning classifiers are utilized to classify date fruits, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and a Voting Classifier that combines the predictions of multiple base classifiers.


REQUIREMENTS

•	Python 3.x

•	Jupyter Notebook

•	scikit-learn
